This week’s task was to implement and evaluate a ML classifier that can be used to classify healthy vs cancer samples and to compare its performance to a SVM model solution. 

For the evaluation of the model a confusion matrix and a ROC curve for training and validation sets, as well as the identification of the 18 most important features have been utilized for comparison with the performance of the original model, which was provided by the paper “Identifying and analyzing different cancer subtypes using RNA-seq data of blood platelets”
