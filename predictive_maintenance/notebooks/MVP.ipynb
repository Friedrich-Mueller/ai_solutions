    "### Understand the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"One-Year Industrial Component Degradation\" is a high-quality, real-world Predictive Maintenance (PdM) dataset that allows to infer from raw sensor signals a state/health detection. The data covers the state of a cutting blade that is used in some industrial machine. Since the blade can not be inspected visually during operation due to the blade being enclosed in a metal housing and its fast rotation speed, predictive maintance can be applied to monitor its degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data covers the state of the blade over the span of a whole year. We assume that at the beginning of that year in which the data was farmed, the blade was in some 'best' state, which is either perfect condition or acceptable condition or something inbetween. And for the sake of the task, we assume that in the last 5% of the time (e.g. end of the year) the blade enters a state of some 'maximum' degradation which requires maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This task could be a classification task, where each sample is binned via equal frequency (or equal depth). But also, it could be a regression task, where each sample is assigned a percentage of degradation based on its position on the timeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of the blade being used in different 'modes', there is an assumption that perhaps some modes are only used rarely. For example, if for whatever reason, one mode was only used once near the end of the year, and equal frequency binning would be applied, it could happen that said rare mode would be binned in the respectively latest bin, which would represent 95-100% degradation and indicate a need for maintenance. Now if that mode was used at an earlier point in a following year, the monitoring would immediately suggest a maintenance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, applying a regression based solution makes alot more sense, with the assumption of a continuous degradation of the blade, regardless of mode."
